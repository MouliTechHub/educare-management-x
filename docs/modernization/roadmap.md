# School Management System - Modernization Roadmap

## Executive Summary
Transform the current school management system into a production-ready, scalable, real-time application through systematic modernization across data, security, performance, and user experience.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Security (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Establish solid data foundation and security model

### 1.1 Data Model Normalization
- [ ] Add tenant_id to all tables with proper foreign keys
- [ ] Implement soft-delete pattern (deleted_at, deleted_by)
- [ ] Add audit columns (created_by, updated_by) to all tables
- [ ] Create audit_log table for critical action tracking
- [ ] Add referential integrity constraints and check constraints
- [ ] Normalize student-guardian relationships

**Acceptance Criteria**: Zero orphaned records, all tables have proper FKs, audit trail complete

### 1.2 Row-Level Security Implementation  
- [ ] Implement RLS policies on all tables
- [ ] Create security definer functions for role checks
- [ ] Define role hierarchy: admin > accountant > teacher > parent > auditor
- [ ] Add tenant isolation policies
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing

**Acceptance Criteria**: All data access controlled by RLS, role-based permissions working

### 1.3 Canonical Data Views
- [ ] Create v_student_profile (unified student view)
- [ ] Enhance v_fee_grid_consolidated (single row per student/year)  
- [ ] Create v_payment_history_unified (payments + discounts)
- [ ] Create v_academic_progress (enrollments, promotions, status)
- [ ] Add materialized views for heavy reports

**Acceptance Criteria**: UI uses canonical views, query count reduced by 60%

## Phase 2: Real-time & Performance (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal**: Add real-time capabilities and optimize performance

### 2.1 Real-time Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement realtime channels for fee updates, payments, promotions
- [ ] Add React Query with realtime invalidation
- [ ] Create notification pipeline (email/SMS/push)
- [ ] Add background job queue for async operations
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms and dead letter queues

**Acceptance Criteria**: Real-time updates < 2s latency, 99.9% message delivery

### 2.2 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add composite indexes for common query patterns
- [ ] Implement query budgets (≤3 queries per page)
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize fee calculation and promotion RPCs
- [ ] Add database connection pooling

**Acceptance Criteria**: P95 page load < 2.5s, RPC success rate ≥ 99.9%

### 2.3 Background Jobs
- [ ] Nightly aggregate recomputation (dues, collections, aging)
- [ ] Orphan data cleanup jobs
- [ ] Automated reminder system
- [ ] Data archival and retention policies
- [ ] Health check and monitoring jobs

**Acceptance Criteria**: All heavy computations moved to background, zero blocking operations

## Phase 3: Reliability & Testing (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal**: Achieve production reliability and comprehensive testing

### 3.1 Comprehensive Testing Suite
- [ ] Unit tests for all financial calculations
- [ ] Integration tests for critical RPCs (payments, promotions, discounts)
- [ ] End-to-end tests for key user journeys
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent user scenarios
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests for resilience

**Acceptance Criteria**: 90% code coverage, all critical paths tested

### 3.2 Observability & Monitoring
- [ ] Structured logging with request tracing
- [ ] Metrics dashboard (latency, errors, business KPIs)
- [ ] Alerting for system health and business anomalies
- [ ] Performance monitoring and profiling
- [ ] Security monitoring and incident response

**Acceptance Criteria**: Full observability stack, MTTR < 15 minutes

### 3.3 Data Quality & Integrity
- [ ] Implement promotion safety guards (snapshot verification)
- [ ] Add data validation rules and constraints
- [ ] Create data fix scripts and procedures
- [ ] Implement referential integrity dashboards  
- [ ] Add data quality monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria**: Zero data corruption incidents, automated quality checks

## Phase 4: User Experience & Scale (Weeks 13-16)
**Goal**: Enhanced user experience and horizontal scalability

### 4.1 UI/UX Modernization
- [ ] Unified fee grid with enhanced payment history
- [ ] Bulk operations (payments, discounts, reminders)
- [ ] Mobile-first parent portal
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Internationalization and localization

**Acceptance Criteria**: User satisfaction > 90%, mobile usage supported

### 4.2 Advanced Features
- [ ] Advanced reporting and analytics
- [ ] Integration APIs for third-party systems
- [ ] Workflow automation (approvals, notifications)
- [ ] Document management and digital receipts
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering

**Acceptance Criteria**: Feature parity with enterprise systems

### 4.3 Scalability & DevOps
- [ ] Horizontal scaling architecture
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Infrastructure as code
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Multi-environment management

**Acceptance Criteria**: System supports 10,000+ concurrent users

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Page load time P95 < 2.5s
- API response time P95 < 500ms  
- System uptime ≥ 99.9%
- Zero data loss incidents
- Test coverage ≥ 90%

### Business KPIs
- User adoption rate > 90%
- Support ticket reduction by 70%
- Financial accuracy 99.99%
- Report generation time < 30s
- Mobile usage > 40%

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Data Migration**: Gradual migration with rollback plans
2. **Breaking Changes**: Feature flags and backward compatibility
3. **Performance Regression**: Continuous monitoring and rollback triggers
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular audits and penetration testing

### Mitigation Strategies
